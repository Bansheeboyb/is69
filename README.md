# is-69ing
NPM package for quickly and effectively checking a number to see if it is 69 and if so return "Nice".

NEW FEATURE!
You can now pass a string as well to is-69ing and it will automagically convert and check the string to see if it equals 69 as well. It does all the hard work for you! We wanted to make it that much easier for you to use is-69ing seamlessly in your own projects!
