# is-69ing
NPM package for quickly and effectively checking a number to see if it is 69 and if so return "Nice".

NEW FEATURE!
You can now pass a string as well to is-69ing, and it will automagically convert and check the string to see if it equals 69 as well. It does all the hard work for you! We are working hard to make it simple and easy for you to use is-69ing seamlessly in your own projects!
